Mizore
======

Simple C# solr library project codenamed "Mizore".
The name and state of the projects (documentation, tests, etc.) will improve in future.

This is a very early alpha implementation and NOT yet intended for production use!
All the Intrfaces, classes and other elemtents are still subject to change and might break every check-in.


The goal of this project is to create a small but extendable library which is fast, stable and offers freedom.
